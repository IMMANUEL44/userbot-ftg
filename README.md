# Friendly Telegram Userbot
A fast, easy to setup telegram userbot running Python 3 which uses the [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/ "Telethon") Library.

Friendly Telegram, also known as FTG, is not your average Telegram userbot: it's faster, can load modules dynamically and is very easy to use!

# Important 
This is  not my work instead i have just ported the original work from [here](https://gitlab.com/friendly-telegram/friendly-telegram "Original repo") for it to work [here](https://github.com/IMMANUEL44/workflows/tree/userbot "Workflow")

### Setup (With/For github)
- First of all clone this repo and push it to your private repo
- Then clone the repo from your github and do the initial setup once for the firt time in your pc/phone following the steps from the documentation below
- Once the bot has been succesfully done with setup and is up and running commit all the changes done to the repo and push it to your private repo
- Then go [here](https://github.com/IMMANUEL44/workflows/tree/userbot "Workflow") and follow the instructions in the Readme.md and run the workflow
- Boom!! you have succesfully hosted your bot on github

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or above
- API ID and Hash from [Telegram](https://my.telegram.org/apps)

### Documentation
We've made docs to help you to set-up the bot.
They can be found [here](https://friendly-telegram.gitlab.io "Documentation").

### Support
We also have a dedicated Telegram support group. Got any doubts or issues while setting-up? Shoot 'em here! **Please read the docs first** though, to make sure your question isn't already answered!
